              <h2> Welcome to my Website</h2>
              <p class = "profile-description"> Passionate about web development, I love to create web applications that are simple yet beautiful to make people's life easier. 
                I am always looking for optimized solutions to enhance user experience.

                <br /> <br />
                Experienced Financial Advisor and Financial Planning Specialist with a demonstrated history of working in the financial services industry since 2014. 
                Skilled in Portfolio Management, Microsoft Excel, Customer Service, Microsoft Word, and Financial Planning. 
                Strong finance professional with a Bachelor of Science (BS) focused in Corporate Finance from San Jose State University and MBA focused in International Business from Assumption University.

                <br /> <br />
                Being a passionate problem solver, I decided to switch my career from Finance to the Tech world. 
                Not only am I motivated by the challenges of new projects, but also I love spending my time on resolving problems on computers. 
                Eventually, I am making my dream come true by pursuing my career path in web development.

                <br /> <br />
                Graduated the full stack web developer boot camp at UC Berkeley Extension, I am proactively looking for opening positions where I can find opportunities to expand my knowledge and work on challenging projects.
